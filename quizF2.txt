PC WON'T BOOT TO BIOS

	- Maybe it is caused by a faulty ram, try to replace another RAM or
	transfering it to another slot. Another causes are faulty PCI cards,
	misplaced front panel connectors. PSU is not working properly, missing
	power supply cables (check the 24 pin ATX cable and the 4 pin or 8 pin 
	CPU connectors ) or the CPU is dead.
