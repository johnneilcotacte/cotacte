HOW DID THE RASPBERRY PI WORKK?
   
	- During the troubleshooting process, the charger we used was not compatible
	with the raspberry pi B since the model B uses between 100mA depending on what 
	peripherals are connected. In our final troubleshoot we connect to the right 
	and compatible charger and fortunately it is functional and still working.
